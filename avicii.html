His debut studio album, True (2013), blended electronic music with elements of multiple genres and received generally positive reviews. It peaked in the top ten in more than fifteen countries and topped international dance charts;[4][5][6][7] the lead single, "Wake Me Up", topped most music markets in Europe and reached number four in the United States.</p>
